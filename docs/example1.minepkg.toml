# closed proprietary nature of it.

# The default install source should allow version lookups like this:
# journeymap = "1.4.2"
# This bit is borrowed from cargo: Version numbers without any operators
# should default to `^<version>` (caret operator) which only includes non-breaking changes
# so writing "1.4.2" should be eqaual to "^1.4.2"
# Version 1 of this format should include support for the following semver features:
# journeymap = "^1.0.0" – caret operator (default)
# journeymap = "~1.0.0" – tilde operator
# journeymap = "2.0.1-beta.2" – prerelease
# journeymap = "1.0.0 - 3.0.0" – range
# journeymap = "1.x.x" – range
# https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges provides a good explanation of the operators mentioned above
